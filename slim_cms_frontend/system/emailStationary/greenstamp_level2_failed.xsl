				<p>Businesses who are awarded with Level 2 Accreditation must demonstrate that they have moved beyond compliance to incorporate a minimum number of sound environmental management practices into their day-to-day operations. This could include the recycling of particular wastes, use of less toxic chemicals, inclusion of more efficient systems that minimise resource use, emergency spill kits or energy saving devices.</p>
